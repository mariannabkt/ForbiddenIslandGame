This repository contains the implementation of a digital version of the cooperative board game *Forbidden Island*. The game was developed as part of an academic project for the AUEB's C++ Programming Course using [Simple Game Graphics Library](https://github.com/cgaueb/sgg). It follows the rules and mechanics of the original board game, where players work together to collect treasures and escape from a sinking island.

## Game Overview

In the Forbidden Island game, players assume different roles with unique abilities and collaborate to retrieve the four hidden treasures before the island sinks. The island gradually floods, making certain areas inaccessible, and players must strategize to prevent the island's complete submersion. If players recover all treasures and escape via the helicopter pad, they win the game. If any critical game piece is lost or the island sinks entirely, the players lose.

## Features

- **Turn-based Gameplay:** Players take turns to perform actions such as moving, shoring up flooded areas, and collecting treasure cards.
- **Treasure Collection:** Players must gather the correct sets of treasure cards to recover each treasure.
- **Role-based Abilities:** Players can select from a variety of roles, each with unique abilities that influence the game's strategy.
- **Flood Mechanics:** Island tiles randomly flood and disappear over time, adding tension to the gameplay.
- **Win/Loss Conditions:** Players can either win by collecting all treasures and escaping or lose if certain conditions are met (e.g., the helicopter pad sinks).
- **Graphical Interface:** The game features a graphical user interface (GUI) displaying the island grid, player positions, and game state.
